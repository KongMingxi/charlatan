We monitored the accuracy of our embeddings over the course of training our CNN. The validation set is a dataset of 1000 triplets such that 100 triplets are created from each of the 10 validation videos. After the end of training, 736/1000 samples fulfilled the triplet constraint. 930/1000 fulfilled the contrained without the added margin. I.e. $\norm{x_a - x_p} < \norm{x_a - x_n}$.

For comparison after 10 epochs of training the values were 467/1000 with margin and 894/1000 without the margin.

The t-SNE plot of a validation trajectory suggests that the network has learned a meaningful and well-behaved embedding of the video frames. Embeddings of frames that are close to each other in the video are close to each other in the dimentionality reduced regime.
